# toTitleCase
The provided code defines a JavaScript function toTitleCase that converts a given string to title case. Title case means that the first letter of each word in the string is capitalized, and the rest of the letters are in lowercase.
In this example, the toTitleCase function is applied to the inputString, which transforms it into title case, and the result is stored in titleCaseString. The output of console.log(titleCaseString) displays the transformed title case string.
